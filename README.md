## Installation

### CocoaPods

CHCircleGaugeView is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), to install it simply add the following line to your Podfile:

`pod "CHCircleGaugeView"`

### Manually

To install manually, just copy everything in the `CHCircleGaugeView` directory into your Xcode project.

_**Important:**_ If your project doesn't use ARC you must add the `-fobjc-arc` compiler flag to all CHCircleGaugeView implementation files in Target Settings > Build Phases > Compile Sources.

## Usage

Instantiate like any other view and customize it as needed:

```objective-c
- (void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated {
    [super viewDidAppear:animated];
    
    CGRect frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 200, 200);
    CHCircleGaugeView *circleGaugeView = [[CHCircleGaugeView alloc] initWithFrame:frame];
    [self.view addSubview:circleGaugeView];
    
    [circleGaugeView setValue:0.5 animated:YES];
}
```

### States

There is a `state` property of type `CHCircleGaugeViewState` that determines how to display a few things.

* `CHCircleGaugeViewStateNA`: "n/a" is displayed in the center of the circle and the gauge inside the track will not be present. The displayed string can be changed by setting the `notApplicableString` property on the gauge.
* `CHCircleGaugeViewStatePercentSign`: "%" is displayed in the center of the circle and the gauge inside the track will not be present. The displayed string can be changed by setting the `noDataString` property on the gauge.
* `CHCircleGaugeViewStateScore`: A whole number (with an optional units suffix) is displayed in the center of the circle and the gauge inside the track will represent the value.

Modifying or setting the `value` property will automatically cause the state to switch to `CHCircleGaugeViewStateScore`.

### Setting Values

To change the value of the gauge you can call `setValue:animated:` or set `value`.

### Configuration

The gauge can easily be configured by adjusting public properties:

* `trackTintColor`: The color shown for the portion of the gauge that is always filled.
* `gaugeTintColor`: The color shown on top of `trackTintColor` for the portion of the gauge that varies based on the `value` property.
* `textColor`: The color of the text.
* `font`: The font of the text.
* `trackWidth`: The width for the portion of the gauge that is always filled. Defaults to a value of 0.5.
* `gaugeWidth`: The width for the portion of the gauge that varies based on the `value` property. Defaults to a value of 2.
* `unitsString`: String that is a suffix on the `value`. This string is meant to be just a few characters long. Defaults to `nil`.
* `notApplicableString`: The text shown when the state of the gauge is `CHCircleGaugeViewStateNA`. Defaults to "n/a".
* `noDataString`: The text shown when the state of the gauge is `CHCircleGaugeViewStatePercentSign`. Defaults to "%".
* `gaugeStyle`: Determines how the gauge is drawn relative to the track. Defaults to `CHCircleGaugeStyleInside`.
